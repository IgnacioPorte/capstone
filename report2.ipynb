    "There are a lot of communes in Santiago. To choose the better on with need to see a lot of other variables such as housing prices and schools ratings. Then. choose the best neighborhood to live in. In first place I scraped the data from wikipedia, then i preprocessed the data   with pandas to get the info that I want. When the data was preprocessed i used the Foursquare API to find venues near the coordinates of each commune of Santiago de Chile. Finally y used the Clusters k-means algorithm to classify differents types of Communes with similar characteristics."

From this information with the API I was able to get more than 600 different places near the communes, places of which had a certain pattern of appearance in some communes that when classifying the communes through Clusters came to light."

With this info We were able to find the best commune to live based on the lifestyle, and needs of the Chilean."
